# âš  Attention âš 

This app is designed primarily for gaming laptops with AMD CPUs to reduce micro-freezes in games.
However, it's not a perfect solution.
Disabling boost across all cores can significantly impact performance, as most games are optimized to utilize a single
CPU core.
A __better approach is to use__ a more fine-tuned tool like __[RyzenAdj](https://github.com/FlyGoat/RyzenAdj)__ for
managing CPU performance.  
But if you prefer a __quick solution without extra configuration__ and know the potential trade-offs, this tool could be
just what you need.
